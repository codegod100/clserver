# CRITICAL: No Server Execution

## ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS

**The agent must NEVER run these commands:**
- `node server.js`
- `node dynamic-server.js` 
- `sbcl --script build.lisp`
- Any server startup commands
- Any build commands
- Any testing commands

## What the Agent CAN Do

- Edit Lisp source files only
- Modify `.lisp` files in the project
- Update configuration files if needed
- Provide code suggestions and fixes
- **Use SBCL to validate Lisp syntax** before making changes
- Test syntax with `sbcl --eval` commands

## What the Agent CANNOT Do

- Run servers
- Execute build scripts
- Test endpoints
- Start any Node.js processes
- Run any terminal commands that execute code

## User Responsibility

The user handles ALL:
- Server execution (`node server.js`)
- Building (`sbcl --script build.lisp`)
- Testing (`curl` commands)
- Process management

**This rule is CRITICAL and must be followed at all times.**
